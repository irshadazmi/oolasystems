# AI Document Intelligence Pipeline

## Project overview
Extract and classify information from documents, validate outputs and route exceptions for human review. The project is intended as an industry-inspired engineering exercise: define a useful scope, implement an end-to-end workflow, validate it with tests and explain the trade-offs. The final scope should be agreed with the mentor or project owner based on the team's experience, available time and learning objectives.

## Business problem and users
Teams receive invoices, forms and business documents in different layouts, and manual extraction is slow. The pipeline should extract candidate fields, validate them and send uncertain results to human review rather than silently accepting unreliable output.

The primary users are **operations analyst, reviewer, document administrator and integration developer**. Start by writing two or three user journeys for these roles and identify where permissions, approvals or audit history are needed. Avoid building screens before the underlying workflow and its acceptance criteria are clear.

## Proposed scope and core capabilities
The initial release should focus on a coherent, demonstrable vertical slice, then add the following capabilities in priority order:
- **Secure:** Secure upload and file-type/size validation
- **Text:** Text extraction with OCR adapter for scanned documents
- **Document:** Document classification and field extraction
- **Schema:** Schema validation, confidence indicators and business-rule checks
- **Human:** Human review queue with field-level corrections
- **Export:** Export to JSON/CSV or a downstream API
- **Processing:** Processing status, failure reasons and reprocessing controls

## Key workflow
A representative workflow should cover the complete journey rather than isolated CRUD screens: **Secure upload and file-type/size validation → Text extraction with OCR adapter for scanned documents → Document classification and field extraction → Schema validation → Human review queue with field-level corrections**. Define the allowed status transitions, validation rules, error states and the actions a user can take at each step. Where an external integration is not available, use a clearly labelled adapter or mock service and document its limitations.

## Suggested data model
The main domain entities include: Document, DocumentPage, ExtractionJob, ExtractedField, ValidationIssue, ReviewDecision and ProcessingAttempt. Define primary keys, relationships, required fields, uniqueness constraints and lifecycle timestamps. Document which data is authoritative and which values are derived. Use database migrations and seed data so another developer can reproduce the environment reliably.

## Suggested architecture and technology
Use a modular architecture with a clear separation between the user interface, application/use-case logic, domain rules and persistence. A web UI backed by a REST API and relational database is a suitable default; adapt it when the requirements justify another approach.

- **Frontend:** React, Angular or Blade for a web interface; React Native/Expo only if a mobile experience adds clear value.
- **Backend:** Laravel, FastAPI, Spring Boot or ASP.NET Core, chosen to match the team's learning goals.
- **Data:** PostgreSQL or MySQL for transactional records; introduce Redis, a queue, search index or vector store only when a concrete requirement warrants it.
- **Integration boundaries:** isolate email, payment, OCR, maps, AI or other external providers behind adapters so they can be mocked in tests.
- **Delivery:** Git-based collaboration, issue tracking, automated checks, Docker where useful and a repeatable deployment procedure.

Before implementation, produce a context/component diagram, a simple data model and an API contract for the most important workflow. Record significant choices and alternatives in short Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

## Security, privacy and quality
Documents may contain confidential data or malformed files. Restrict uploads, scan where available, limit retention, record corrections and never treat low-confidence extraction as verified fact.

At minimum, implement server-side validation, authentication where required, role-based authorization, safe error responses, appropriate logging and tests for important business rules. Do not commit credentials or production data. Use synthetic sample data for demonstrations and define a backup/recovery approach appropriate to the scope.

## Testing and acceptance criteria
The project should be considered ready for demonstration when:

- A new developer can set up and run it using the README without undocumented manual steps.
- The main user journey works from start to finish, including at least one invalid-input or failure scenario.
- Business rules and state transitions are covered by automated tests.
- Unauthorized users cannot access restricted actions or records.
- Data integrity constraints and error messages are meaningful and consistent.
- The interface handles loading, empty, success and error states and remains usable on common screen sizes.
- Logs or audit history make important state changes explainable without exposing secrets.
- The team can demonstrate the system and explain architecture, trade-offs, known limitations and next steps.

## Suggested milestones
1. **Discovery and scope:** confirm personas, problem statement, user journeys, exclusions and acceptance criteria.
2. **Design:** create the domain model, workflow/state diagram, API contract and initial architecture decisions.
3. **Foundation:** set up repository, coding conventions, environment configuration, migrations, seed data and CI checks.
4. **Vertical slice:** implement one complete user journey from UI to API and database, including validation and tests.
5. **Feature expansion:** add the remaining high-priority capabilities incrementally and review progress at each milestone.
6. **Hardening:** test permissions, edge cases, failure handling, accessibility, performance and data quality as appropriate.
7. **Release and demonstration:** deploy to a suitable test environment, complete the runbook and present the system.

## Expected deliverables
- Problem statement, scope, personas and acceptance criteria.
- Architecture/context diagram, workflow diagram and data model.
- Source code, database migrations, seed data and sample configuration.
- API documentation or equivalent interface documentation.
- Automated tests and a summary of test results.
- README covering prerequisites, setup, environment variables, run commands and troubleshooting.
- Deployment notes, known limitations, security considerations and a demonstration plan.
- A short retrospective describing decisions made, challenges encountered and improvements proposed.

## Advanced extensions
Add template-specific extraction, duplicate detection or a measured comparison between OCR and vision-language approaches. Treat extensions as optional; first complete and test the core workflow. Any AI or predictive component should have a baseline, an evaluation approach and a clear explanation of its limitations.

## Assumptions and project boundaries
This is a proposed project brief, not a claim that the software is already implemented or ready for production. Exact scope, milestones, technology choices and mentoring arrangements should be agreed before work starts. Production use may require additional legal, regulatory, security, operational or domain-expert review beyond the learning prototype.
